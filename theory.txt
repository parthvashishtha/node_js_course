package.json is used to store the dependencies or chexk them 
package -lock.json contains the dependencies tree 
(It is helpfull because if we want to know which version of dependencies are required to run a 
certain modules we have to check the dependency tree..)

nodemon (very helpfull in htttp server)
npm (node package manager: used to install packages or modules and many more)
e.g npm install express
npm i -g nodemon("install the nodemon globally")
npm
